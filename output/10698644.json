The AEC is responsible for conducting federal elections and referendums, maintaining the Commonwealth electoral roll and making sure the Australian public is informed about all electoral matters. Our goal is to see that all eligible Australians have a voice in our democracy.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Diversity makes our democracy strong and we believe it makes our organisation strong. We are committed to workplace diversity and actively encourage applications from people with disabilities, women and people with diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   We recognise the richness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and the unique knowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees bring to our workplace. We welcome and encourage applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   The AEC is committed to political neutrality, so that all Australians have confidence in the fairness and integrity of our electoral system. A person who is, and is seen to be, active in political affairs, and intends to publicly carry on this activity, is therefore not eligible for employment with the AEC.\n   <br/>\n   \n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>",
