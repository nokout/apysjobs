At the end of each 6 month period if you are still interested in working for ACIC, you will need to update your application.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   The ACIC will review the information provided and if we identify a vacancy that matches your skills and experience, we will be in contact with you. While the register is open you will be able to edit/update or withdraw your application once it is submitted.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   We thank you for your interest and time spent in completing the registration process.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Contact: Recruitment Team - recruitment@acic.gov.au\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   This register may be used to engage employees to perform duties on a non-ongoing or casual basis depending on operational requirements. There is no guarantee that any work will be available. For casual positions the nature of irregular and intermittent work means there can be no expectation of work of any particular pattern or duration. This register is intended for non-ongoing opportunities only and applicants should have no expectation of gaining ongoing employment through this register. More information about the ACIC can be found on our website www.acic.gov.au.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <h3>\n    Eligibility\n   </h3>\n   <br/>\n   This is a position of trust. The occupant must satisfy and abide by the Commission\u2019s security requirements, which include Australian citizenship. The occupant must also satisfy a rigorous security assessment by the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency. In assessing suitability for employment the ACIC conducts a pre- employment screening process. This requires the applicant to complete a pre-employment screening form for the purpose of character and background checking, and a psychological assessment. Suitability to meet this criterion is assessed against the ACIC Values.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <h3>\n    Notes\n   </h3>\n   <br/>\n   Non-ongoing opportunity will be offered  for a specified term\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Non-Ongoing opportunities will be offered for a period of up to 12 months\n   <h2>\n    About Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC)\n   </h2>\n   The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) was formed to strengthen the ability to respond to crime affecting Australia.
